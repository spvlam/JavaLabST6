1: Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
The CompactDisc class aggregates Track objects.
The Store class aggregates Media objects.
The Cart class aggregates Media objects.
2:Suppose we are taking the Comparable interface approach:
The class whose objects need to be compared should implement the Comparable interface.
In the implementing class, the compareTo() method should be implemented to reflect the desired ordering.
This method should compare the relevant fields of the objects and return a negative integer if the current instance is less than the other,
0 if they are equal, and a positive integer if the current instance is greater than the other.
With the Comparable interface approach, we can only have one ordering rule for the items. The compareTo() method defines the single way of comparing objects.
To accommodate a different ordering rule for DVDs compared to other media types (by title, then decreasing length, then cost),
 we can introduce a conditional statement within the compareTo() method of the DVD class. 
This statement would check the type of the other object being compared and apply the specific ordering logic for DVDs, 
considering title, decreasing length, and cost. 
This way, the comparison and ordering can be customized for DVDs while maintaining the standard behavior for other media types.
